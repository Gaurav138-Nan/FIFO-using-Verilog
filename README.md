# FIFO-using-Verilog

Here we are implementing synchronous as well as asynchronous FIFO using Verilog.

**ASYNCHRONOUS FIFO:**
An asynchronous FIFO refers to a FIFO design in which the FIFO buffer is accessed while reading and writing 
using two different clock domains.That is unlike synchronous FIFO ,here the speed of writing and reading are 
asynchronous to one another.

The design that we are going to do in verilog is based on the below diagram.
